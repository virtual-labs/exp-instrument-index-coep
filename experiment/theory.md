In an EPC (Erection, Procurement and Construction project the job of an Instrumentation and Control Engineer is divided in two categories viz.
1.	Pre Engineering activities
2.	Post Engineering activities

The most of the documentation part of the project comes under Pre Engineering activities while Post Engineering activities involve commissioning activities at site. The success of the project mainly depends on how best and accurate the documentation is being carried out.

For this particular project of setting up of a calibration laboratory the primary goal is to refer to a standard ISO 17025, in this standard few important features of any calibration laboratory are:

1.	Ensuring the impartiality and confidentiality of the calibration laboratory
2.	Establishing a clear organizational structure with defined roles and responsibilities
3.	Implementing a quality management system that covers procedures, equipment maintenance and documentation control
4.	Providing training and ensuring the competence of personnel in the calibration process

Instrument index is a document that is created at the beginning of the project, which contains the list of instruments used in the plant. This document is a vital document used while procuring the instruments, and sizing the PLC. It comprises of details like:

-	Tag number
-	Loop Number
-	Type of Instrument
-	Location
-	Service description
-	P&ID Number
-	Line number or equipment number
-	I/O Type
-	Control System
-	Range or set point along with engineering unit used
-	Applicable reference Document ( Instrument Data Sheet number, P&ID number, Hook-up Drawing number, Instrument Layout number, Loop Drawing number)
-	Package Number
-	Manufacturer
-	Model Number
